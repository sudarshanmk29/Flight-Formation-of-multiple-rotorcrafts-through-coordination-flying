Coordinate flying of drones or unmanned aerial vehicles(UAVs) is one of the most intricate and vital techniques that many researchers are trying to solve. 
Drones flying in coordination can be used in many applications such as the military, rescue operations, package delivery and many more. 
Coordination flying of drones can expand a single droneâ€™s task coverage radius and also enhance the success rate of task execution. 
Here we address the challenge faced in the coordination and communication of two parallel drones flying in coordination and also the method we are using to overcome this difficulty.
